                    Born June 15, 2002, raised in Baguio City. 2nd Year transferee from AMA Computer College Baguio, Major in Computer Science.
                    I transfered into this school because I want to learn face to face for most of my major subjects, unline in my past school that we only meet online.
                    My hobbies are playing online games, basketball, watching TV series, listening to music mostly RNB, POP, and Kpop.
                    I don't like sleeping but I need one right now, I think sleeping is a waste of time, and you should only sleep the appropriate time you need to sleep, no more than that. 
                    When I was a child, my dream is to become a policeman or join the military because I want to service my country and its citizens. It is still my dream but my parents are against it.
                    Now I am a aspiring to be a Web or Game developer that's why I took computer science.

                    I have 2 siblings and I am the Edlest. The second child is a girl and I am 2 yrs older than her and she is also studying in UB taking Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management.
                    The youngest of us is a boy, we have 12 year gap and he is in Grade 4. My father works as a waiter in a restaurant and my mother is working abroad as a Domestic Helper. She's been there since I was grade 8.
                    I tried working on my first year as a college student to help my parents pay for my tuition. I've work as a kitchen helper in a Korean fastfood restaurant, and I've been a housekeeper in a Hotel here in Baguio.

                    All I do in my free time is watch youtube, scrole through ig and fb and play online games, mostly Valorant. I hit the 2nd highest rank in Valorant (Immortal) 2 years ago. I stopped playing for 6 months,
                    I started working as I am studying so I've been busy, ever since I've been stucked in Ascendant. If I got extra time, money and companion, I like riding my motorcycle and go out of town. We just go
                    in nearby provinces like La Union or Panggasinan for their beaches. Personally I don't like going out, I just like staying at home relaxing and playing games.
